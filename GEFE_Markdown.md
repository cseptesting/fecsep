# Overview


On 1 January 2006, the Working Group of the Regional Earthquake Likelihood Models (RELM; Field2007; Schorlemmer et al. 
2007; Schorlemmer and Gerstenberger, 2007) launched an earthquakeforecasting experiment to evaluate earthquake 
predictability in California.The RELM experiment sparked a series of subsequent regional forecasting experiments in a 
variety of tectonicsettings and the establishment of four testing centers on four different continents (Zechar et al. 
2010;Michael and Werner, 2018; Schorlemmer et al. 2018).

In addition to the regional experiments, CSEP promotes earthquake predictability research at a global scale(Eberhard et 
al. 2012; Taroni et al. 2014; Michael and Werner, 2018; Schorlemmer et al. 2018).Compared to regional approaches, global
 seismicity models offer great testability due to the relativelyfrequent occurrence of large events worldwide (Bayona et
 al. 2020). In particular, global M5.8+earthquake forecasting models can be reliably ranked after only one year of 
prospective testing (Birdet al. 2015). In this regard, Eberhard et al. (2012) took a major step toward conducting a 
global forecastexperiment by prospectively testing three earthquake forecasting models for the western Pacificregion. 
Based on two years of testing, the authors found that a smoothed seismicity model performsthe best, and provided useful 
recommendations for future global experiments. Also based on twoyears of independent observations, Strader et al. (2018)
 determined that the global hybrid GEAR1model developed by Bird et al. (2015) significantly outperformed both of its 
individual modelcomponents, providing preliminary evidence that the combination of smoothed seismicity data 
andinterseismic strain rates is suitable for global earthquake forecasting.
