# Overview


On 1 January 2006, the Working Group of the Regional Earthquake Likelihood Models (RELM; Field 2007; Schorlemmer et al. 
2007; Schorlemmer and Gerstenberger, 2007) launched an earthquake forecasting experiment to evaluate earthquake 
predictability in California.The RELM experiment sparked a series of subsequent regional forecasting experiments in a 
variety of tectonic settings and the establishment of four testing centers on four different continents (Zechar et al. 
2010; Michael and Werner, 2018; Schorlemmer et al. 2018).

In addition to the regional experiments, CSEP promotes earthquake predictability research at a global scale (Eberhard et
 al. 2012; Taroni et al. 2014; Michael and Werner, 2018; Schorlemmer et al. 2018).Compared to regional approaches, 
global seismicity models offer great testability due to the relatively frequent occurrence of large events worldwide 
(Bayona et al. 2020). In particular, global M5.8+ earthquake forecasting models can be reliably ranked after only one 
year of prospective testing (Bird et al. 2015). In this regard, Eberhard et al. (2012) took a major step toward 
conducting a global forecast experiment by prospectively testing three earthquake forecasting models for the western 
Pacific region. Based on two years of testing, the authors found that a smoothed seismicity model performs the best, and
 provided useful recommendations for future global experiments. Also based on two years of independent observations, 
Strader et al. (2018) determined that the global hybrid GEAR1 model developed by Bird et al. (2015) significantly 
outperformed both of its individual model components, providing preliminary evidence that the combination of smoothed 
seismicity data and interseismic strain rates is suitable for global earthquake forecasting.


# Objectives
  
Describe the predictive skills of posited hypothesis about seismogenesis with earthquakes of M5.95+ independent 
observations around the globe  
Identify the methods and geophysical datasets that lead to the highest information gains inglobal earthquake 
forecasting.  
Test earthquake forecast models on different grid settings  
Use Quadtree based grid to represent and evaluate earthquake forecasts
